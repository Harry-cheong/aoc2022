## fstream
* allows us to work with files 
* to use fstream library, include both the standard <iostream> and the <fstream> header file 

## Classes
    1. ofstream 
    - creates and writes to files 

    2. reads from files
    - reads from files

    3. fstream
    - a combination of ofstream and ifstream: creates, reads, and writes to files

## Write a file 
e.g. 
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Create and open a text file
    ofstream MyFile("filename.txt");

    // Write to the file
    MyFile << "Files can be tricky, but it is fun enough!";

    // Close the file
    MyFile.close(); 
}
* Why do we close the file? : It is considered good practice, and it can clean up unnecessary memory space.

## Read a file
e.g. 

int main() {
    // Create a text string, which is used to output the text file 
    string myText; 

    // Read from the text file
    ifstream MyReadFile("filename.txt");

    // Use a while loop together with the getline() function to read the file line by line
    while (getline(MyReadFile, myText)) {
        // Out put the text from the file
        cout << myText;
    }

    // Close the file
    MyReadFile.close();
}
